This plugin allows quick creation of figures for publications, prensentations and collaboration. 
QuickFigures is designed primarily for Microscopy Images and Western Blots but can also be used for a variety of other figure types. 

QuickFigures is meant to be easy to understand, simple to use, and flexible enough for any sort of figure. 
If you are in a hurry you can learn the basics in less than 10 minutes with [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Crg-FAOHmc&t=416s). 
If you primarily work on western blot figures you may want to watch the [western blot tutorial] (https://youtu.be/SW-EVxAoJR4) and then [install] (https://youtu.be/WOu_P2pf26o).

You can also watch the full length [tutorial video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Crg-FAOHmc&list=PLM5I73cb55tDX4XCjKGK-Jm3-tJsUb7qm) for instructions or you may read the [user guide](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/blob/master/UserGuide/User%20Guide.md) which is more detailed than the full length playlist.
