This plugin can be used to easily create figures for publication, presentation or sharing. These figures can be exported to PDF, PowerPoint, SVG or regenerated in Adobe Illustrator.
It is designed primarily for Microscopy Images, Gels and Western Blots but can also be used for a variety of other figure types. 

QuickFigures is meant to be easy to understand, simple to use, and flexible enough for publication ready figures. 
If you are in a hurry, you can learn the basics in less than 10 minutes with [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Crg-FAOHmc&t=416s). 
If you primarily work on western blot figures you may want to watch the [western blot tutorial](https://youtu.be/SW-EVxAoJR4) and then [install](https://youtu.be/WOu_P2pf26o).

You can also watch the full length [tutorial video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Crg-FAOHmc&list=PLM5I73cb55tDX4XCjKGK-Jm3-tJsUb7qm) for instructions or you may read the [user guide](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/blob/master/UserGuide/User%20Guide.md) which is more detailed than the full length playlist.
